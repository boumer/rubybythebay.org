### Location

George Mason University’s Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation<br>
1500 Remount Rd<br>
Front Royal, VA 22630

The location is only accessible by car — we are helping to [coordinate carpooling](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aA0fJbbmxYW3lTqP6A7zLOnZbECzCd5d9f7L9ok_jLI/viewform?c=0&w=1). Please fill out the form if you need a ride or can offer a ride and Kalimar will do his best to match people up! Contact Kalimar at [kalimar@rubyforgood.org](mailto:kalimar@rubyforgood.org).

If you arrive and the gate is locked, dial #90 at the phone at gate #2 for access.

Once you enter through the gates, drive to the top of the hill (the Smithsonian Tower with yellow and blue sun will be on your right). Make a right after the Smithsonian tower, and parking is on the right.

After arriving, head to the “Residences” building to check in.

### FONZ Tours

The [Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ)](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/JoinFonz/join.cfm) is giving us a personalized, not-open-to-the-public tour of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) grounds and animal habitats so we can learn about red pandas, bison, and other friendly creatures, their homes, and the research being done on-site. We have three tours lined up as indicated above. Only 26 people are allowed for each tour and tours last between 1.5 and 2 hours. Be sure to [reserve your spot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTi3wUj8MJLG637wdYBsasBrca53P7X-FFjXWw-SF2k/edit?usp=sharing) on one of the tours.

### What to Bring

Bring yourself, your laptop, a power source, some clothes and your favorite board games. Maybe some sunscreen if the weather’s nice. If you anticipate skipping group meals, bring some munchies. If you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs. All the basics are provided (linens, pillows, beds, towels, etc.). We have a fun outdoor activity planned for one evening so camping chairs, a sweater and maybe some bug spray are highly recommended.
